This library is an extension of [SForms](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/s-forms) - a semantic form generator and processor for ontology-based smart forms.
SForms components are displayed based on structure of provided semantic form data and extend basic functionality of SForms.
The components can be easily tested using example form which is located in `./example` directory

### Debugging a form & components with StorybookJS

Storybook is an open source tool for building UI components and pages in isolation. Rendering of a form or a specific component can be tested through a story provided in `./src/stories/`. The application can be started by executing npm script through `npm run dev` and then accessing `loaclhost:6006` from a browser. It renders the forms provided by the file `./src/stories/assets/`.
